# WebBuilder React starter

React JSX and Vite, with Tailwind CSS v4 already connected. Edit
`src/pages/Home.jsx`; add routes in `src/App.jsx` only when needed.
`src/main.jsx` imports the global stylesheet. Keep that entry point intact.

## Installed tools

| Purpose | Package | Pinned version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime | Node LTS | 24.21.0 |
| UI | React / React DOM | 19.3.0 |
| Dev server and build | Vite / React plugin | 8.3.0 / 6.1.1 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS / Vite plugin | 4.3.3 |
| Routing | react-router-dom | 7.18.3 |
| Icons | react-icons | 5.7.0 |
| Optional animation | motion | 13.2.0 |
| Lint | oxlint | 1.82.0 |

Use `npm ci` to reproduce the lockfile, `npm run lint` for static checks,
and `npm run build` for the production bundle. The hosted workspace already
runs Vite at port 5173; do not start another server there. To run a downloaded
project locally, use `npm run dev`.

## Styling conventions

Keep `@import "tailwindcss"` at the top of `src/index.css`. This is Tailwind v4:
do not add v3 `@tailwind` directives, a v3 config, or a second PostCSS pipeline.
Keep custom element defaults inside `@layer base` so utility classes can win.
Use complete, statically discoverable class names, not constructed fragments.

The starter supplies neutral `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `bg-surface`,
`text-muted-foreground`, `bg-primary`, `text-primary-foreground`, `border-border`
and `ring-ring` tokens. Change their values to match the requested design.
The `.dark` class on `<html>` activates the dark palette and `dark:` utilities;
no theme-switch UI or persistence is imposed on generated apps.

Use Tailwind for layout, spacing, typography and states. Keep complex custom
artwork in scoped CSS. Preserve visible keyboard focus. Use `motion-reduce:`
or media queries for CSS motion. Do not hide page overflow to conceal layout
bugs, and keep controls usable on narrow screens.

## Animation and icons

Motion is preinstalled but not imported by the starter. For requested complex
animation, import from `motion/react`, not an assumed `framer-motion` package:

```jsx
import { MotionConfig, motion } from 'motion/react'

<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">
  <motion.div initial={{ opacity: 0 }} animate={{ opacity: 1 }}>
    Your content
  </motion.div>
</MotionConfig>
```

`reducedMotion="user"` suppresses transform/layout animation, not every opacity
transition. Use `useReducedMotion` to disable other distracting effects when
needed. Simple hover/focus feedback usually needs only CSS.

Import named icons from one React Icons family, for example `FiArrowRight`
from `react-icons/fi`. Label icon-only controls. Install missing UI kits, charts,
3D tools, or state libraries only when a requested feature needs them.

## Template maintenance

Stable versions were resolved from the npm registry and Node release index on
2026-09-14. Application and browser-tool dependencies have separate lockfiles.
Playwright 1.63.0 and Chromium live outside the app at `/opt/webbuilder-checks`
and `/opt/pw-browsers`; they do not enter generated application bundles.

For a release, review current stable versions, update exact manifest versions,
regenerate both lockfiles, and run lint/build plus desktop/mobile browser checks
with approval. Use the host-side `sandbox/template.py build <name>:<v-release>`
command from the repository root. It uses E2B's native start/readiness snapshot
and returns an exact `name:build-UUID` reference. Promote that reference to staging
with `sandbox/template.py promote <build-ref> --to staging`. Smoke-check a
disposable sandbox before using `--to production`. Set the backend's `E2B_TEMPLATE_ID` to the exact
build reference and restart that backend. Promotion does not run checks or update
the backend environment. Do not resolve
`latest` during user runs. Node tags and Debian system packages are not digest
locked, so the entire operating-system image is not bit-for-bit reproducible.

Existing saved projects retain their recorded template IDs and package files.
They are not automatically upgraded. No generation-speed or design-quality
improvement is claimed without representative generation measurements.

The minimal hooks/Fast Refresh lint rules follow the published create-vite
9.2.1 React preset. No test suite is bundled, per repository policy.
